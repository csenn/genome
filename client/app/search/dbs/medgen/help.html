		MedGen is NCBI’s portal to information about human disorders and other phenotypes having a genetic component. MedGen is structured to serve health care professionals, the medical genetics community, and other interested parties by providing centralized access to diverse types of content. For example, because MedGen aggregates the plethora of terms used for particular disorders into a specific concept, it provides a Rosetta stone for stakeholders who may use different names for the same disorder. Maintaining a clearly defined set of concepts and terms for phenotypes is essential to support efforts to characterize genetic variation by its effects on specific phenotypes. The assignment of identifiers for those concepts allows computational access to phenotypic information, an essential requirement for the large-scale analysis of genomic data.

		Once a concept is defined, MedGen offers a growing collection of attributes about that concept including a definition or description, clinical findings, causative genetic variants and the genes in which they occur, available clinical and research tests, molecular resources, professional guidelines, original and review literature, consumer resources, clinical trials, and Web links to other related NCBI and non-NCBI resources. Convenient access to such a range of supporting data allows MedGen’s users to synthesize and apply the latest knowledge to important clinical and biological questions.
